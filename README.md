## ❓ What

A light bulb simulation application that dynamically adjusts light intensity and visual effects using fuzzy logic. With a slider and switch interface, the program controls the brightness, shadow, and color based on triangular membership functions, offering smooth transitions and real-time adjustments.

## 🛠️ Requirements

To run **FuzzyLight Controller**, you need the following setup:

- **Web Browser**: 🖥️ The project will run in any modern browser.
  - Recommended browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge.
- **No Additional Libraries Required**: 📦 This project does not require any external JavaScript libraries.
- **Basic Understanding of Fuzzy Logic** (optional): 🧠 It's helpful to understand fuzzy logic concepts.

## 🚀 How-to-Use

1. **Clone or Download**: 📥
   - Clone:  
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/lumashade-fuzzylight-controller.git
     ```
   - Download:  
     Download the ZIP file from the repository and extract it to a folder on your machine.
   
2. **Open the Application**: 🌐
   - Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
   
3. **Interacting with the Application**:
   - **Slider Control**: 🎚️ Adjust the light intensity with the slider.
   - **Switch Control**: 🔄 Toggle between low, medium, and high ranges using the switches.
   - **Real-time Feedback**: 💡 Watch the light bulb respond to your adjustments.

4. **Customizing the Code**: 🛠️ Modify the membership functions or logic to experiment with different lighting effects.
